#Learn and implement k-NN and logistic regression models:

#Learn about scikit and surprise packages for recommendation engines:

#Learn how the evaluation is done by Precision@k and Recall @k:

#And compare both the models to find the best accuracy:

                    I learned how to build recommender systemsâ€”like the ones Netflix or Spotify use. I used tools like scikit-learn and Surprise to implement models such as logistic regression, k-NN, and SVD. I also understood key concepts like matrix factorization, latent features, and how to predict user preferences. Along with that, I learned how to evaluate recommendations using metrics like Precision@k, Recall@k, and RMSE to measure how accurate and useful the predictions are.

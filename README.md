# 🎬 IntelliRec: A Smart Recommendation Engine 

**IntelliRec** is an Intelligent Recommendation Engine for personalized user experience.
Here, A collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation engine developed using the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset. It utilizes the **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** algorithm via the `surprise` library to predict user ratings and recommend personalized movies.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Predicts movie ratings for individual users
- 🎯 Personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering
- 🧠 Built on `Surprise`, `Pandas`, `numpy`
- 📈 Efficient data processing for large-scale datasets
- 🛠 Modular, clean, and easy-to-understand code
